			<p class="information"><strong>Command &amp; Conquer: Generals</strong> is a real-time strategy video game developed by EA Pacific and released in 2003. In this universe, an international quasi-terrorist organization known as the Global Liberation Army rose to prominence as one of the main players on the world stage after a series of terrorist attacks throughout the world. After the GLA launched a nuclear attack on Tiananmen Square during a Chinese military parade, the War against the GLA, one of the deadliest conflict in the timeline, officially began. Generals features three factions. Each one plays differently, and has its own advantages and disadvantages.</p>

			<p class="army-desc-right">The USA uses advanced, but oftentimes experimental, technology with precise targeting and well trained infantry. It also commands a powerful air force, which includes the F-22 Raptor and the Aurora strike bomber. The USA's superweapon of choice, the Particle Cannon, allows for more precise and continuous destruction than other factions' crude, area-blast weapons. <!-- <a href="usa.html">Read More...</a> --></p>

			<p class="army-desc-left">The Chinese military - the People's Liberation Army, or PLA - prides itself on its heavy firepower. A Chinese offensive tends to take on the nature of a slow-moving juggernaut, with the PLA employing heavy weaponry and sheer numbers to overwhelm their foes. The Chinese heavily employ propaganda on the battlefield to inspire their soldiers, and China's numerous troops have defended the homeland with a nationalistic zeal not seen anywhere else. <!-- <a href="china.html">Read More...</a> --></p>

			<p class="army-desc-right">The GLA military doctrine involved using stealth and speed as their main war tactics, as well as surprise attacks and suicide bombers. They were also known to implement biological and chemical weaponry, notably anthrax, in their fight against the United States and China. <!-- <a href="gla.html">Read More...</a> --></p>

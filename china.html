		<p class="information">The Chinese military - the People's Liberation Army, or PLA - prides itself on its heavy firepower. A Chinese offensive tends to take on the nature of a slow-moving juggernaut, with the PLA employing heavy weaponry and sheer numbers to overwhelm their foes. The Chinese heavily employ propaganda on the battlefield to inspire their soldiers, and China's numerous troops have defended the homeland with a nationalistic zeal not seen anywhere else.Not as technologically advanced as the American forces and not as fast as their GLA enemies, the Chinese tend to use large vehicles and superior firepower to overwhelm the opponent. </p>

		<p class="home-army-right"><strong>GENERAL "ANVIL" SHIN FAI</strong></p>

A strict disciplinarian, General Fai can mobilize four divisions in less than 24 hours. This General's infantrymen are elite and have all been trained with advanced field training programs. By utilizing several technologies unique to them, this General and his elite soldiers ensure victory on the battlefield.</p>
		<ul>

		<p class="home-army-right"><strong>GENERAL TSING SHI TAO</strong></p>
		<p class="army-desc-right usa-geninfo">The impatient General Tao is determined to get what he wants, whatever the cost. Nuclear weapons are an essential part of his tactical strategy. While there have been accidents as a result of his excessive use of nukes, this General feels that such errors are simply part of the development process. He has successfully pioneered several new technologies including the creation of advanced nuclear power plants and the promotion of stable radioactive isotopes.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>All tanks start with uranium shells and nuclear tank upgrades.</li>
			<li>Power plants now generate more power.</li>
			<li>The Nuke Cannon is available from the start of the game.</li>

		<p class="home-army-right"><strong>GENERAL TA HUN KWAI</strong></p>
		<p class="army-desc-right usa-geninfo">General Kwai is the Chinese People's Liberation Army's biggest tank advocate. Trained in the Soviet tank tactics of the Cold War era, General Kwai has proposed and developed many modifications to the standard Chinese tank arsenal. He has reduced production costs for many tanks and even initiated new tank programs, one byproduct of which is the fearsome Emperor Overlord tank.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>All tanks start at veteran level.</li>
			<li>Tanks cost less to produce, but the time it takes to construct them has not been changed.</li>
			<li>Aircraft are more expensive to build.</li>
			<li>The Nuke Cannon and Inferno Cannon are both unavailable.</li>
